# YouTube Watch History Tracker

A Chrome extension that tracks your YouTube watch history (both normal videos and shorts) and provides detailed statistics and visualizations.

## Created By
Developed by Varun with the assistance of AI.

## Features

- Automatically tracks both normal YouTube videos and shorts
- Maintains view counts for rewatched videos instead of creating duplicate entries
- Provides detailed statistics in a dashboard view
- Export your watch history as JSON data
- Filter data by various time periods
- Debug console for troubleshooting

## How This Differs From Google Takeout

Similar to how you can check your YouTube stats by downloading data from Google Takeout, this extension provides more specialized tracking:

- Automatically separates videos into shorts and normal videos
- Tracks in real-time without waiting for periodic exports
- Generates clean, structured JSON that can be used with other programs for deep analysis of viewing patterns
- Provides immediate statistics without needing to process large data dumps
- Focuses specifically on what you watch, not other YouTube activities
